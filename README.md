##### Bowling aka the Lebowski

Ok so you're given a kata (because measurement) and you suck at TDD?  What do you do?

You do your goddamned best and try to tdd-loop things.

When in doubt and you fall, go ahead and write code, wrap test, refactor code, test behavior should never change.

This is just a sampling...

Btw this is based on Bob Fowler's bowling Kata, minus the API.
